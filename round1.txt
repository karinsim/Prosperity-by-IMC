at every timestep:

checking own trades (self.update_open_pos)
- see if previously open position has been closed
- match own buy and sell trades
- CAUTION: Prosperity server seems to re-initialise Trader at random times (Trader suffers from amnesia!)

tracking position
- long and short shouldn’t cancel out - track buy and sell separately
(since it’s possible for all buy orders but no sell order to be executed and vice versa)

1. RESIN
market take
- if ask/bid below/above fairprice, want to buy a lot (how much?)
- else: if previously bought very low, can sell at a lower price

market make
- fill remaining orders up to position limit
- submit buy orders at lowest price possible
- trade off between low price and probability of execution: use param1 to control proportion bought at low/lower prices
- vice versa for sell orders



2. KELP
- market take: check fairprice based on market maker
- since position limit is relatively large, don’t have to hurry to close all position
- market make: send buy/sell orders below/above fp
