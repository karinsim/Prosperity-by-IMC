# Prosperity 3 by IMC: Team Island Boy Island

The IMC Prosperity3 challenge is a 15-day competition that focuses on developing trading algorithms. Participants are tasked with building and optimising trading bots capable of generating profits, backtesting their strategies on the provided historical data. The challenge provides a simulated environment where participants can test and evaluate their models against others.

## Project Overview
This repository contains the code we used in the IMC Prosperity3 challenge.

Additionally, there are several utility functions for backtesting and research:

<details>
  <summary>ðŸ’¹ get_midprice_mm</summary>
  Calculates the theoretical midprice corresponding to the prices quoted by the market-making bots. Inspired by the discovery made by Linear Utilities ([source](https://github.com/ericcccsliu/imc-prosperity-2)).

<details>
  <summary>ðŸ“‰ find_signal_.. (zscore, momentum, breakout)</summary>
  Implements various strategies to identify trading signals based on statistical methods such as z-score, momentum, and breakout patterns.
