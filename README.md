# Prosperity 3 by IMC: Team Island Boy Island

The IMC Prosperity3 challenge is a 15-day competition that focuses on developing trading algorithms. Participants are tasked with building and optimising trading bots capable of generating profits, backtesting their strategies on the provided historical data. The challenge provides a simulated environment where participants can test and evaluate their models against others.

## Project Overview
This repository contains the code we used in the IMC Prosperity3 challenge.

Several utility functions are available to analyse the log files generated by the Prosperity server:
- get_prices_log: extracts price and PnL data from the end-of-round log files.
- get_tradehistory: extracts trade history (both own and market trades) from log files and outputs the data as a pandas dataframe.
- get_mytrades: extracts own trades from the dataframe returned by `get_tradehistory` for a specified product.
- get_orderbook: extracts the orderbook at each timestep, provided that itâ€™s printed correctly by the Trader class.

Additionally, there are several utility functions for backtesting and research:
- get_midprice_mm: calculates the theoretical midprice corresponding to the prices quoted by the market-making bots. Inspired by the discovery made by Linear Utilities ([source] https://github.com/ericcccsliu/imc-prosperity-2).
- find_signal_.. (zscore, momentum, breakout): implements various strategies to identify trading signals based on statistical methods such as z-score, momentum, and breakout patterns.
- calculates the spread between the ETF and its synthetic using the size-weighted mid-price (introduced in Round 2).
